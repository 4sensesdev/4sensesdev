"We live in a time where it's easy to connect with others, technology is abundant, and advancements are constantly happening. However, along with these advancements, there's a lot of loneliness, anxiety, depression and other social issues that make it hard for us to work together with people who are different from us. What's more, the intense competition in society often makes us more selfish, individualistic, and exclusionary, surrounded by Deceptively Acquired Merit Stockpilers, always ready to seek for gold, which exacerbates these problems and slows down our progress in developing new ways of understanding our surroundings and what we know exists but is not yet within our reach."

I honestly don't know if I could see the arrival of that day, where *we can all cooperate with each other and walk into the future as One*, but until that day comes, I will be here learning what I can to be able to help those who need it.

**Hello!** My name is **4sensesdev** and I'm just a "code user" with a big goal, **to become one of the best data analysts/data scientists in the world and to be able to help a lot of people in the process!**

I have more than three years of experience working with data and software for both temporal and spatial processing and analysis.

Since 2021, from one day to the next I lost at least 70% of my vision, now I have irreversible visual impairment and yes, here I am, writing this, to show what I can do, and what I have learned to do since that moment.

For those wondering, why someone with a visual impairment is trying to learn to code when could be doing something simpler? Well, the answer is easy, if I don't do what I can while I still can, in the future it may be too late, this reminds me of a phrase I heard a while ago that says: **_"The day we give up will not be the end of our journey, it will only be the beginning of a worse future."_**

<br>
<br>

In this account I will be publishing projects where Iâ€™ll be applying some things I learned in my career along with everything I have learned and what I will learn here in this community.

Of course, I won't use too much technical language, as the idea is to explain some interesting things for me, but in a simpler way. I believe knowledge should always be shared in a clear and easy-to-understand manner, and I'd like to try to explain everything as simply as I can.

### Here are some of the software I use.
-	Python
-	R
-	Qgis
-	Excel

    and others...
